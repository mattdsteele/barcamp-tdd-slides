#2 most popular opinion. Why is this?

How widespread is this opinion? (show of hands)

Testing still in the minority - X % of projects contain it

So why do it?

1. Proves code is correct

2. Fast feedback loop

Closest we can get to this with normal tools is TDD

3. Refactoring
I do it for me 
Provides a safety net

4. Prevents you from doing stupid shit

4. Makes you happy


Any surprise languages we've historically valued least (JS) had the least testing?
