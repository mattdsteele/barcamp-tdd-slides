Slides from my talk Zen and the Art of TDD, which I presented at [Omaha Barcamp](http://barcampomaha.org/) on September 8, 2012.

The slides are a web application built using [Showoff](https://github.com/schacon/showoff). They are published [here](http://barcamp-omaha-tdd.herokuapp.com/).

Video of the talk and other resources are available in this [blog](http://matthewsteele.wordpress.com/2012/09/09/zen-and-the-art-of-tdd-barcamp/).
