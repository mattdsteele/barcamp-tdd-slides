So why do it?

# 1. Proves code is correct

!SLIDE
Tests have two lives; when you're writing them, and then forever on.

Gives you behavior preservation.

2. Fast feedback loop

Closest we can get to this with normal tools is TDD

3. Refactoring

5. Design effects
Testing code that hasn't been written tests beforehand is a nightmare. (example jquery code)
You write your code very differently as you're writing it. (use bkeeper's example)
Solving design problems solves testing problems

!SLIDE
6. Makes you happy

!SLIDE
Any surprise languages we've historically valued least (JS) had the least testing?
