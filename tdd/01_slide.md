# Unit testing won't help your code

> The only reason to have Unit tests is to make sure that code that already works doesnâ€™t break. 
Writing tests first, or writing code to the tests is ridiculous.

So why do it?

!SLIDE
# 1. Proves code is correct

!SLIDE
Tests have two lives; when you're writing them, and then forever on.

Gives you behavior preservation.

# 2. Fast feedback loop
Inventing on Principle https://vimeo.com/36579366
Closest we can get to this with normal tools is TDD

!SLIDE
# 3. Refactoring
I do it for me 
Provides a safety net


!SLIDE
# 4. Better design
Testing code that hasn't been written tests beforehand is a nightmare. (example jquery code)
You write your code very differently as you're writing it. (use bkeeper's example)
Solving design problems solves testing problems

> Under low-pressure conditions, the higher individuals' WM, the more likely they were to use computationally demanding algorithms ... and the more accurate their math performance. Under high-pressure conditions, higher WM individuals used simpler (and less efficacious) problem-solving strategies, and their performance accuracy suffered.
