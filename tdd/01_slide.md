# Unit testing won't help your code

!SLIDE
> The only reason to have Unit tests is to make sure that code that already works doesn't break. 
Writing tests first, or writing code to the tests is ridiculous.

Gives you behavior preservation.

# 4. Better design
Testing code that hasn't been written tests beforehand is a nightmare. (example jquery code)
You write your code very differently as you're writing it. (use bkeeper's example)
Solving design problems solves testing problems

Working Memory

> Under low-pressure conditions, the higher individuals' WM, the more likely they were to use computationally demanding algorithms ... and the more accurate their math performance. Under high-pressure conditions, higher WM individuals used simpler (and less efficacious) problem-solving strategies, and their performance accuracy suffered.
